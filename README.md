# Basic Brute Force Example

This repository contains a simple Python script that demonstrates how brute force attacks work by trying every possible combination of characters until it matches the target password. The project shows how fast weak passwords can be cracked and why secure credentials are necessary.

## ðŸ”§ How to execute

1. Clone this repository or download it as a ZIP:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WilianColdAP38/bruteforce-password.git
   cd bruteforce-password



ðŸ“Š Sample run

With the test password "Ec2@", the terminal showed the following output:

Password found: Ec2@
Tries: 11590264
Time: 4.1668 seconds



# Observations

## I realized that passwords made of only a few letters are guessed really fast.  
## When I switched to longer ones that mix symbols, numbers, and uppercase letters, the search time grew a lot.  
## This showed me that every extra detail in a password makes it much harder to break.
